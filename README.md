# My personal resume

For the redesign of my resume I wanted to use HTML5 tech, like SVG and CSS.
However Word does not like svg that much, so I needed to 'build' my artwork and decals.

The contents of this repository is both personal and private.
Please handle it with care... Thank you

I have made this publicly accessable for the purpose of education and portfolio.
